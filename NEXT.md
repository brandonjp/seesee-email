# Next Steps — SeeSee

**Version:** 0.18.0-dev
**Updated:** 2026-02-22

## Just Completed

- **Expanded theme catalog** (Phase 4):
  - 21 total themes (up from 10): 4 accent, 8 developer, 4 light, 6 retro
  - New developer themes: Monokai, Tomorrow Night, Rosé Pine, Catppuccin Mocha, Obsidian
  - New light themes: Paper, Aqua Classic, Blueprint (with CSS grid overlay)
  - New retro themes: Amber Terminal, VHS (scanlines), Mac OS 9 (beveled borders), Rad (neon glow)
  - Scoped CSS overrides for Blueprint, VHS, OS 9, and Rad — zero bleed between themes
  - Theme picker reorganized: Accent → Developer → Light → Retro
  - 272 tests passing

## Highest Priority Next Task

- **CSV/JSON search export** — add export buttons to the email search page that download filtered results as CSV or JSON files.

## Other Candidates (from ROADMAP Phase 3.0)

- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Multi-user auth with roles
- WordPress plugin with settings page
- Postgres support as alternative to SQLite
- STARTTLS support for SMTP ingest
- Notification alerts ("App X hasn't sent email in 24 hours")
