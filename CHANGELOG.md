## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Core API endpoints (Phase 1.0 — Core API + Storage):
  - `POST /api/v1/apps` — register app (returns API key + SMTP credentials, shown once)
  - `GET /api/v1/apps` — list registered apps (admin auth required)
  - `POST /api/v1/log` — log a single email (API key auth, body storage mode enforcement)
- API key authentication dependency with O(1) prefix-based lookup
- Admin HTTP Basic Auth for management endpoints
- Body storage mode enforcement (full / text_only / preview) per app
- Body preview generation (first 500 chars, auto-strips HTML when no text provided)
- FTS5 sync triggers for automatic full-text search indexing on email insert/update/delete
- Slug generation utility for app names (unicode-safe, collision-resistant)
- Enhanced health check endpoint with database status probe
- Consistent error response format (`{"error": "...", "detail": "..."}`)
- Comprehensive test suite: 34 tests covering auth, apps, ingest, health, FTS, and storage modes

### Changed
- Registered ingest and apps routers in main app
- Static files mount now checks for directory existence before mounting
- Removed deprecated license classifier from pyproject.toml
